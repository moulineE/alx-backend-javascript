## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What ES6 is
- New features introduced in ES6
- The difference between a constant and a variable
- Block-scoped variables
- Arrow functions and function parameters default to them
- Rest and spread function parameters
- String templating in ES6
- Object creation and their properties in ES6
- Iterators and for-of loops

## Requirements

### General

- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `js` extension
- Your code will be tested using the Jest Testing Framework
- Your code will be analyzed using the linter ESLint along with specific rules that will be provided
- All of your functions must be exported

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x
   - In your home directory:

     ```bash
     curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
     sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
     sudo apt install nodejs -y
     nodejs -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint
   - In your project directory, install Jest, Babel, and ESLint by using the supplied `package.json` and run:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. Configuration files
   - Add the following files to your project directory:
     - `package.json` [View Contents](url-to-package-json-file)
     - `babel.config.js` [View Contents](url-to-babel-config-file)
     - `.eslintrc.js` [View Contents](url-to-eslintrc-file)

4. Finally…
   - Don’t forget to run `npm install` from the terminal of your project folder to install all necessary project dependencies.
