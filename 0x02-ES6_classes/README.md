# Project Title: ES6 Classes

## Overview

This project delves into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript, particularly focusing on ES6 classes. By completing the tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to define classes, add methods, work with static methods, extend classes, and explore metaprogramming using symbols.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to define a Class
- How to add methods to a class
- Why and how to add a static method to a class
- How to extend a class from another
- Metaprogramming and symbols

## Requirements

- All files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `.js` extension
- Your code will be tested using Jest and the command `npm run test`
- Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint
- Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project running `npm run full-test`

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x

   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
   nodejs -v # Should show v12.11.1
   npm -v # Should show 6.11.3
