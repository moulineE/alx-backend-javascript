## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Promises (how, why, and what)
- How to use the `then`, `resolve`, `catch` methods
- How to use every method of the Promise object
- Throw / Try
- The `await` operator
- How to use an async function

## Requirements

- All files executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use the `.js` extension
- Code will be tested using Jest with the command `npm run test`
- Code will be verified against lint using ESLint
- All functions must be exported

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x

   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
   nodejs -v # Should show v12.11.1
   npm -v # Should show 6.11.3
